# Knight moves (Knight's Travails)

## Goal
Find the shortest way for a knight from one square, to another. From the starting square, assume that all the moves made are children of a node. 

## Pre project thoughts
I have been looking forward to this. I really enjoy chess, but have never done anything more than play. I think that breadth search makes the most sense, because depth first could potentially cause the search to be infinte, altough it is unlikely. Theoretically in depth first it could just jump between the first
